## Tips for Success

1. **Start each day by reviewing the plan**
2. **Check off completed tasks immediately**
3. **Document blockers as they occur**
4. **Run tests after each significant change**
5. **Commit code frequently with descriptive messages**
6. **Update this README with actual dates and progress**

## Notes

- Each day's plan is a **guideline**, not a strict requirement
- Adjust based on actual progress and discoveries
- Some days may take longer, some shorter
- Build buffer time for unexpected issues
- Prioritize working code over perfect code
- Refactor as you learn more about the domain
